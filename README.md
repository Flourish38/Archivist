# The Archivist
This bot's main goal is to be able to archive an entire discord server with minimal permissions, and be able to restore channels from a previously created archive.

By default, it will also track the audit log if granted that permission to.

This is code that I want to be sound enough that I am comfortable trusting my life to it. I place a lot of value on the deep history of interactions that discord has saved between me and my friends, and I would be absolutely crushed to lose it. There might a bot that already does something similar, but I don't feel like I will be comfortable unless I write it myself. Here we go.
